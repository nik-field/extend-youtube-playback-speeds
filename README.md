# Extend YouTube Playback Speeds

This is a very simple Chrome extension that extends the available playback rate options provided by YouTube.

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you find simpler ways to do this or you want to suggest a feature.

## Why?

I could not find another extension that did just this one simple thing and I can't stand feature bloat.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Google Chrome.
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner.
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension's directory from your local machine.

## Support

If you find this extension useful and want to send me a buck or two, you can.

## License
